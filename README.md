Hello! Welcome to my mini-project, SPFcheck.io.  

This software provides a no-nonsense website where engineers can check their domain names for correct and working email SPF record implementations.  

I wanted to help improve the security on the internet, and perhaps get a little better at coding whilst I'm at it.  


More updates to follow.
